This is the working repository for chemical-protein binding affinity prediction using [DeepPurpose](https://github.com/kexinhuang12345/DeepPurpose), model comparison between DeepPurpose and [MONN](https://github.com/lishuya17/MONN), and clustering chemicals based on their molecular descriptors generated by [`mordred`](https://github.com/mordred-descriptor/mordred) and RDKit. 

If you are interested in using the full pipeline proposed in "[Compound Screening with Deep Learning for NeglectedDiseases: Leishmaniasis](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v165/smith22a/smith22a.pdf)", please see this [repository](https://github.com/jajsmith/drug-repurposing-leishmaniasis).
